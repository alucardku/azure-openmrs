This repository contains automation to deploy [OpenMRS](https://openmrs.org/), (Open Medical Records System) on Azure. Great work being done on this project on the [OpenMRS Repo](https://github.com/openmrs/openmrs-core).

This template allows you to deploy an Ubuntu Server 18.04-LTS VM with Docker
and starts an OpenMRS container listening on port 8080 which uses MySQL database running
in a separate but linked Docker container, which are created using Docker Compose. The shell script validates service functionality before finishing; the deployment typically takes about 10 minutes. The docker-compose file is using the ``demo`` docker image tag, it is recommended to change this to ``latest`` if you are deploying into anything besides a lab or demo environment.

This deployment will listen on HTTP/8080 by default and has a public IP resources associated with it, if this is for an internal deployment please [dissociate the public IP address](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-network/remove-public-ip-address-vm) from the VM.

When the deployment is complete you can access the system by going to ``http://PublicIPAddress:8080/openmrs`` or ``http://AzureDNSname:8080/openmrs``. The tomcat configuration in the official openmrs container (currently) points to the root webapp and needs the ``/openmrs`` path appended.

The ***default credentials*** for this deployment are in the [docker-compose.yml file](all-in-one/docker-compose.yml) and by default the login for OpenMRS is ``admin/Admin123``. 

## Access FHIR Endpoints

OpenMRS [supports FHIR](https://talk.openmrs.org/t/fhir-module-and-export-import-based-testing/2063/3)
Here are steps to quickly access FHIR data in newly created OpenMRS instance
1. Login with admin/Admin123 to the Registration Desk
3. Add a sample patient (THIS IS REQUIRED, NONE of the fhir endpoints worked for me without it)
4. Metadata endpoint http://<yourip>:8080/openmrs/ws/fhir2/R4/metadata
5. Patient endpoint: Bundle: http://<yourip>:8080/openmrs/ws/fhir2/R4/Patient/
